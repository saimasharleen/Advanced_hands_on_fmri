# Lookalike-Objects Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the analysis scripts for two assignments using the lookalike-objects dataset. The first assignment involves multiclass decoding to characterize the representational profiles of three ROIs. The second assignment employs Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to compare neural, behavioral, and DNN data.

## Assignment 1: Multiclass Decoding

### General Goal
Using the lookalike-objects dataset, characterize the representational profile of the inferotemporal regions (V1, VTC_post, and VTC_ant) with regard to specific animal and tool identities.

### Question
Do the activation patterns associated with the 9 lookalike objects generalize to their corresponding animal (e.g., whether cow-shaped mug is represented similarly to a real cow) and/or to their corresponding object identity (e.g., cow-shaped mug to the mug)?

### Tasks
1. Use a multiclass (9-way) decoding approach to test whether the patterns of activity for the lookalike objects generalize to their corresponding animals and/or objects (in all subjects, in the 3 ROIs).
2. Visualize the results for the 3 ROIs (bar plot with mean decoding accuracies, error bars with standard error of mean).
3. Summarize the results and statistics in a table (mean accuracies, t and p values).
4. Describe and interpret the results.
