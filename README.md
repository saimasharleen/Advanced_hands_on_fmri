Using the lookalike-object data set (dataset 2) for the following assignments:
Assignment 1: (Moritz’s module)
General goal: Using the lookalike-objects dataset, characterize the representational profile inventrotemporal regions (V1, VTC_post, and VTC_ant) with regardto specific animal and tool identities.
Question: Do the activation patterns associated with the 9 lookalike objects generalize to its corresponding animal (e.g. whether cow-shaped mug is represented similarly to a real cow, etc.) and/or to its corresponding object identity (cow-shaped mug to the mug, etc.)?
Your tasks:
• Use a multiclass (9-way) decoding approach to test whether the patterns of activity for the lookalike objects generalize to their corresponding animals and/or objects (in all subjects, in the 3 ROIs)
• Visualize the results for the 3 ROIs (bar plot with mean decoding accuracies, error bars with standard error of mean)
• Summarize the results and statistics in a table (mean accuracies, t and p values)
• Describe and interpret the results
Assignment 2: (Stefania’s module)
General goal: Employ RSA to describe similarities/differences of representational spaces in different data types (neural data, behavioural ratings, and deep neural networks).
Question: Does the representational space for each data type reflect object visual appearance (appearance model) or object animacy properties (animacy model)?
Your task:
• Use RSA to test how well the two models (appearance and animacy) explain the representational space in three data types:
brain data: 1 ROI (V1, post VTC, ant VTC)
behavioural data (single subject ratings: “SimJudgments” mat file) DNNs (Alexnet all layers)*
• Visualize the results for the 3 data types (RSA results and models)
• Summarize the results and statistics (you can also add a table to give an overview)
• Results section (describe rationale for the analyse and report results)
• General discussion of results
• Upload scripts
